### Game Rules

Based off of the popular Hangman game, the rules as dictated by Cory Althoff are:

  1. The computer selects a secret word and draws a line for each letter.
  2. The user tries to guess the word one letter at a time.
  3. If the user guesses a letter correctly, the computer replaces the corresponding line with the correct letter.  If a letter appears twice in a word, the user has to guess it twice.
     OR
     If the user guesses incorrectly, the computer draws a body part of a hanged stick figure starting with the head.
  4. If the user completes the word before the drawing of the hangman is complete, they win.  If not, they lose.
